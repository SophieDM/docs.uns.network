# Understanding UNS

UNS is the shortname of Universal Name System.

**Universal-Name-System** is the distributed network and the protocol dedicated to handle IDs rooted in the blockchain, aiming to secure any web connections and to protect the user's privacy.

**Universal-Name-System** and its IDs are the backbone of the @unik-name solutions : 
- `my @unik-name` : personal user's ID to replace email and password, and to control their own data over the web.
- `@unik-name Connect` : the easiest and safest authentication solution for any saas platforms and mobile apps.
- `@unik-name Certificate Pinning` : the solution to secure mobile apps against falsified SSL X509 certificates and against man-in-the-middle attacks.
- `@unik-name Trust Domains` : the anti-phishing solution

**Universal-Name-System** has been designed to be used easily by other who needs to integrate self-sovereign identifiers in their software and applications. 

## Key Advantages

**If you're a Network Player**, Universal-Name-System represents an opportunity to participate, to contribute and to get valuable rewards with a viable decentralized solution. You're going to contribute to securing the first DID operational blockchain with its easy to understand use case.

**If you're a User**, Universal-Name-System offers highly secure and highly available backbone solution to manage connections with your users, customers and partners. Don't care about what's under the hood, let's play with user oriented @unik-name solutions.

## Core Design

Universal-Name-System features include : 
- **Enhanced Sovereign IDs** (also called DID for Decentralized Identifiers), protected against spoofing, anonymous, with a managed lifecycle.
- **Personal Data Registry**, under sole user's control, with permissioned access.
- **Network Players** considered as service providers, with rewarding per services.
- **Reward guarantees** due to the business model and the token economy.
- **Fully decentralized Governance** model (target design).
- **Scalable** network, with possible gateway redundancy.
- **Very High Availability** with unlimited and cheap relay nodes.

## Under the hood

UNS blockchain runs with a token used to secure the network and to rewards network players. UNS blockchain works also with another token, the UNIK Token, a NFT Token representing @unik-name Identifiers.
