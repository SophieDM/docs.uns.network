# Becoming a uns.network Player

[[toc]]

## Introduction

The uns.network Command Line Interface (CLI) makes it easy to create and manage your @unikname and Unikname apps directly from the terminal.
It’s an essential part of using uns.network.

### Checking your delegate status in the Explorer

You can check on [explorer](https://sandbox.explorer.uns.network/delegate-monitor) that your @unikname is in the delegate list, in the `standby` tab.
To enter into the `active` state, you need to set up a forging node.

### Checking your delegate status in the Explorer

Now, your job is done.
You can check on [explorer](https://sandbox.explorer.uns.network/delegate-monitor) that you're in the delegate list (either in `active` or `standby` tab).

If you're in the `active` tab, congratulation, you're a <uns/> delegate, and your forger node is actually forging blocks and getting rewards.

If you're in the `standby` tab, you need to gather more voting power than current active delegates (i.e. have wallets with positive balance voting for you).
