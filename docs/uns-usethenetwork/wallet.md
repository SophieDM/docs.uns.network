title: Wallets for UNS tokens and UNIK tokens
---

# Wallets

## Basic Wallets

Both UNS and UNIK tokens are managable with a command line interface (CLI). But this is not really user-friendly. 

So in addition, UNS tokens can be managed easily with the UNS Desktop wallet. This is a fork of the ARK.io wallet so the UX is really the same, and security has already been proven.  _More informations to come!_

Management of UNIK tokens require the @unik-name APP.

## @unik-name APP

The @unik-name mobile APP is not only an app to manage his/her owns @unik-names and its properties. The @unik-name mobile APP is also, and before all, a wallet. This APP embed cryptographic and secured features like handling pass phrase, handling private keys and calculating public addresses. 

So the @unik-name mobile APP is the prefered user APP to manage @unik-names but also UNS tokens, UNIK tokens, and to trigger transactions requiring tokens.
