# Wallets

## Basic Wallets

Both UNS and UNIK tokens are manageable with a command line interface (CLI). But this is not really user-friendly. 

ArkEcosystem comes with a lot of out-of-the-box tools for bridgechains like UNS. 
Among those tools, we have the awesome [Desktop Wallet](https://ark.io/wallet) which is fully compatible with UNS network. 
From a single wallet application, you can manage your ARK **AND** UNS tokens easily. 
By default, the app connects to Ark mainnet. But with a simple configuration, you can connect to UNS too. Let's do it !

:warning: *this tutorial has been written for the Ark desktop wallet verion `2.6`. It could not work properly with newer versions.* 

First of all, download and install the app for your platform : https://ark.io/wallet
*works with Windows, macOS and Linux*

Unfortunately, you must setup Ark wallet first before to be able to setup UNS wallet. 
So, follow Ark [instructions](https://docs.ark.io/tutorials/usage-guides/how-to-use-ark-desktop-wallet.html) on how to setup and use application. 
From now, you should have a perfectly configured desktop application to manage ARK tokens. 
But, if you're here, it's probably to configure application to manage UNS token and here we are. 
It's simple and it requires only two steps: 
- setup new network configuration
- create a new dedicated profile.

### 1. Setup a new network configuration

Go to `manage network` section (bottom-left of navigation bar).
Then click on : `Add a new network` (top-right)
Fill inputs:
- name: **UNS Devnet**
- description: **UNS devnet network**
- seed server: **http://163.172.146.222:4200**
And click on `Fetch` to automatically get full node configuration (like token name, explorer url or wallet derivation keys).

Guess what ðŸ¤”, you've just completed the first step to configure your wallet ! Congrats ðŸŽ‰

### 2. Crate a new dedicated profile

Click on your profile (last item of navigation bar).
Then `Add profile` (top-left). 
Fill-in all inputs like you did for Ark profile.
Now, in step `2. Network` you can choose the freshly appeared `UNS Devnet` item.
At the end, you should have a fully configured Desktop wallet able to transfer UNS, create wallets, vote for delegates, or any other features inherited from ArkEcosystem.

If you want to start playing, you can contact us and we'll send you `DUNS` : our Devnet UNS tokens.

Management of UNIK tokens require the @unik-name APP.

### How to setup Desktop Wallet



## @unik-name APP

The @unik-name mobile APP is not only an app to manage his/her owns @unik-names and its properties. The @unik-name mobile APP is also, and before all, a wallet. This APP embed cryptographic and secured features like handling pass phrase, handling private keys and calculating public addresses. 

So the @unik-name mobile APP is the prefered user APP to manage @unik-names but also UNS tokens, UNIK tokens, and to trigger transactions requiring tokens.
