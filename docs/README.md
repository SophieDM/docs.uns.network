## Navigating the Docs

Our documentation is a central hub for all knowledge UNS Ecosystem, and as such it's designed to be useful to readers of all technical backgrounds. If read from cover to cover, you'll learn everything from the basics of blockchain to how to create a blockchain of your own — and much more besides.

Below you can read short summaries of each chapter and the topics you'll find within them. The documentation will be edited and expanded frequently as development continues, so check back often for updates.

### [From Blockchain to UNS](/introduction)
This is our introduction to the world of blockchain and UNS's place within it.

Blockchain is a good place to begin if you have little prior experience with blockchain. It answers many common questions about what blockchain is, why it's useful in a naming system.


### [The UNS Ecosystem Guidebook](/guidebook/)

In this section, we describe the software components of the UNS Ecosystem. We focus in particular on UNS Core: the codebase powering the nodes that, in turn, power the UNS network.

[_Core_](/guidebook/core/) describes the architecture of UNS Core. At present, the documentation focuses on the packages that allow for easy application and blockchain customization.
[_Contribution Guidelines_](/guidebook/contribution-guidelines/) details the process for contributing to UNS Ecosystem software. Reading this section also helps to understand the coding styles and practices that inform development across the Ecosystem.
[_Guides_](/guidebook/guides/) offers software-specific information on how to develop for UNS Ecosystem. From running your first test suite to submitting pull requests for your code's inclusion into UNS itself, this is the section to read if you're a developer looking to get involved.

### [The UNS Ecosystem Tutorials](/tutorials/)

The counterpart to the Guidebook, the tutorials contain practical code snippets and guides to help developers write productive code with the UNS Ecosystem as quickly as possible. We'll always provide context for the code we post here, so you'll have the convenience of copy-and-paste and the knowledge to strike your own path when necessary.

[_Usage Guides_](/tutorials/usage-guides/) describe how to use the various UNS packages, including:

1. [Desktop Wallet](/tutorials/usage-guides/how-to-use-UNS-desktop-wallet.html)
2. [Mobile Wallet](/tutorials/usage-guides/how-to-use-UNS-mobile-wallet.html)
3. [Explorer](/tutorials/usage-guides/how-to-use-UNS-explorer.html)

### [UNS Ecosystem Cryptography](/cryptography/)

This section provides details and insights into the cryptographic identities of the UNS blockchain. It covers topics such as PrivateKeys, PublicKeys, and Signatures; as well as the hashing and encoding methods used by UNS.

### [UNS API](/api/)

This section describes the structure of all UNS APIs, as well as usage examples. After you've read the Guidebook and tutorials, this section should be the first place you turn to find out how to interact with the UNS Ecosystem software.

[_Public API_](/api/public/) describes the API that's accessible through any UNS node. API references for UNS v1 and v2 are included.
The [_SDK_](/sdk/) section includes information on how to use the UNS API wrappers we've written for supercharged development in JavaScript.

[_P2P_](/api/p2p/) outlines the functions available to the P2P API.

[_JSON-RPC_](/api/json-rpc/) contains instructions on how to use the JSON-RPC API to interact with the UNS blockchain. This technology is of particular interest to exchanges looking to use a Bitcoin RPC-like interface to integrate UNS into their platform.

[_Webhooks_](/api/webhooks/) describes how to use the webhooks feature of UNS v2 to "listen" to events on the UNS blockchain. This is especially useful for developers who are looking to drive action in their applications in response to specific blockchain events (transactions, vote, etc.)

### [FAQ](/faq/)

We answer some of the most common questions about UNS Ecosystem here, from general questions about UNS philosophy to specific tips on how to resolve commonly encountered errors.
