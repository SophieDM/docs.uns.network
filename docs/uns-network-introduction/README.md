# Understanding uns.network

<uns/> is the distributed network and the protocol dedicated to handle IDs rooted in the blockchain, aiming to secure any web and mobil connections, and to protect the user's privacy. This blockchain is specialized in providing decentralized ID (also called DID), and offer a good Distributed Public Key Infrastructre (also called DPKI) solution, the basis of the next generation of authentication protocols.

<uns/> and its IDs are the backbone of the Unikname solutions : 
- `my.unikname`: personal user's ID to replace email and password for fully confidential sign-up and sign-in, and to control sharing of personal or business information over the web.
- `Unikname Connect`: the easiest and safest authentication solution for any saas platforms and mobile apps, providing a protection against economic espionage for business.
- `Unikname Certificate Proofing`: the solution to secure mobile apps against falsified SSL X509 certificates and against man-in-the-middle attacks.
- `Unikname Anti-Phishing`: the solution that inhibits phishing hacks attempts to any websites.

<uns/> has been designed to be used easily by everyone who needs to integrate self-sovereign identifiers in their software and applications, not only DAPP but also any traditional web plateform.

## Main purposes

### Decentralized IDs

Individuals or entities have ultimate control over their identifier and are the final arbiter of who can access and use their data related to it. Decentralized IDs are available every time and everywhere.

### On-Chain / Off-Chain personal registry

Owners can attach data to their IDs within on-chain and/or off-chain registries, and serve many purposes. They control the privacy level and the sharing of their data : fully private, with white lists, open.

### End to End Private Communication Channel

Every IDs can be reached pseudonymously on the decentralized network. Fully encrypted peer to peer communication can be established between @unikname.

### Compatible with existing web & mobile Apps

<uns/> APIs and SDKs can be easily used in any web and mobile Apps, even traditional centralized ones (heavy client, SaaS, Platforms...)

## Key Benefits

### If you're a Network Player

<uns/> represents an opportunity to participate, to contribute and to get valuable rewards with a viable decentralized solution. You're going to contribute to securing the first Decentralized IDentifiers (DID) operational blockchain with its easy to understand use case.

### If you're representing a Business

<uns/> offers a backbone solution to provide confidential authentication with your users, customers and partners. It's also a good solution to certify your domain URLS and Don't care about what's under the hood, let's play with user oriented Unikname solutions.

### If you're a web user

<uns/> this network is going to provide you your universal ID, replacing your email and password. Use it evereywhere on the web, keeping all your connections fully confidential and untraceable. In addition you can use your new pseudo to  share personal public information, like your pgp keys, your crypto keys, your git pages, your favorite avatar or whatever you want, accessible everywhere by everybody. 

## Core Design

<uns/> features include : 

- **Enhanced Sovereign IDs** (also called DID for Decentralized IDentifiers), protected against spoofing, anonymous, with a managed lifecycle.
- **Personal Data Registry**, under sole user's control, with permissioned access.
- **Network Players** considered as network service providers, with rewarding per services.
- **Reward guarantees** due to the business model and the token economy.
- **Fully decentralized Governance** model (target design).
- **Scalable** network, with possible gateway redundancy.
- **Very High Availability** with unlimited and cheap relay nodes.

## Under the hood

<uns/> blockchain runs with a token used to secure the network and to rewards network players. <uns/> blockchain works also with another token, the UNIK Token, a NFT Token representing @unikname or any other Identifiers.

## Our networks

We're maintaining 2 public networks, a live one and a test one: 

- **SANDBOX**: development network (equivalent to _testnet_ or _devnet_ on other blockchains). Used to test and discuss new features with community before making them available for all. Tokens are **valueless** (you can get them for free [from the faucet](/uns-use-the-network/#sandbox-faucet). Use them to test next features and your apps based on UNIK tokens. 

- **LIVENET**: main network (equivalent to mainnet on other blockchains). Here it's real. Tokens are **valuable** and you must use them with caution. *This network will be available soon*.
